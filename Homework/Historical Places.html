	<p> After the Colosseum, one of Rome's best preserved monuments is the Pantheon. It was originally meant to be a pagan temple only to be later converted into a church. The original rectangular facility, which was comprised of 16 granite columns, serves as the porch of the dome structure. The immense preserved building, located in Piazza della Rotonda, makes photographs postcard perfect. To this day, engineers remain in awe of the unsupported dome structure and maintain it is impossible to replicate. The piazza where the Pantheon is located also happens to be a favorite hangout for young people and features many outdoor cafe. caf√©s. BUS: 40, 64, 46, 916

	<p>One of the best preserved monuments and best examples of Ancient Roman architecture in the city is the Colosseum. It took nearly ten years to build one of the world's largest public venues: heroic arches, columns and windows that stood 160 feet high and a seating capacity of 50,000 which made this arena so immense and prominent. Construction of the arena was ordered by Vespasian in A.D. 72 and was inaugurated by Titus in A.D. 80 with combat games involving gladiators and animals. Aside from bloody battles, legend has it that Christians were also fed to the lions at the Colosseum. BUS: 87, 571. METRO: Colosseo

	<p>Thanks to Fellini's Dolce Vita, the Trevi Fountain has served as a picturesque backdrop for Hollywood blockbusters like Three Coins in a Fountain and Roman Holiday and a dream come true for young women looking for love. Legend has it, throwing a coin into the Trevi Fountain, will ensure you a return trip to the Eternal City. The fountain is a dramatic aquatic marvel for visitors thanks to its vast basin ensconced between three tiny streets (the "tre vie,") with cascades of water that appear to be streaming from the wall of Palazzo Poli. Believe it or not, the Trevi Fountain is quite the money maker. Authorities say it rakes in some ?600,000 a year, all of which is donated to charity.

	<div align="center"><img src="https://img1.10bestmedia.com/Images/Photos/251680/p-St-Peter-s-Square--Vatican-City_54_990x660_201404251340.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt="Peter's Basilica" width="500" height="300" alt="resim"></div>
	<p>Commonly referred to as the 'mother of all churches,' St. Peter's Basilica was commissioned in 324 AD by Constantine as a church to be dedicated to the Apostle Peter. The church was reportedly built on the burial site of this most influential Christian, who was crucified upside down in the nearby Circus of Nero in 64 AD. The original church was destroyed in the 16th century, and the present church was built on the same site. Guided tours of excavations around Peter's tomb are available. Fall and winter closures are about one hour earlier. It is also possible to visit the top of St. Peter's dome by either climbing the stairs (about 500 steps) for 5 euro or taking the elevator all the way up for 7 euro. METRO: Ottaviano/San Pietro, BUS: 46, 64, 492.

	<p>Ever since its completion in 1726, visitors even to this day are taken aback by the beauty of the Spanish Steps otherwise known as the 'scalinata' (staircase) to the locals. The three flights and landings represent the Trinity, and you almost feel as though you could be climbing toward Heaven's Gates as you ascend. Once you reach the very top of the steps, the bird's eye view of the Roman rooftops, the prestigious palazzi and the hustle and bustle of the piazza; you begin to realize just how stunningly beautiful Rome really is. BUS: 117, 119 or 590. METRO: Spagna
